Making Plugins Translatable
---------------------------

The plugin base class has a `translate` static method which is used to
retrieve bootstrapped functions for translations inside the plugin. Use it
to translate strings inside your code:

```php
class MyPluginsConfig extends PluginConfig {
    function getOptions() {
        list($__, $_N) = Plugin::translate('my-plugin');
        $__('This string is translatable');
    }
}
```

The `translate` method will return two functions (more may be retrieved in
the future), the first is used to translate a single string. The second is
used to translate plural strings. They mimic the `__()` and `_N()` functions
inside the core osTicket code base.

The $name and other static properties as well as content in the `plugin.php`
file can also be translated. Simply add a comment immediately before the
strings with the content of `trans`, and then translate it when necessary:

```php
class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
    static $name = /* trans */ 'A super-awesome plugin that does stuff';

    function getName() {
        list($__) = self::translate('my-plugin');
        return $__(self::$name);
    }
}
```

This method overcomes the PHP limitation preventing static properties from
being even remotely dynamic. The PO scanner will recognize the translatable
string by the preceeding `trans` comment. The translated string will be
available in the plugin once translated.

Compiling PO files
------------------

Use the `make-pot` compiler in the osTicket code base to search and compile
the PO file for plugins

    php /path/to/osticket/setup/cli/manage.php i18n make-pot \
        -R auth-plugin \
        -D auth-plugin \
        > auth-plugin.po
